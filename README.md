This project is a two-player digital recreation of 8-ball pool developed entirely in Java. The game uses object-oriented design, real-time physics simulation, and custom rendering and graphics using libraries to approximate the feel of a traditional billiards table. Players take turns aiming and striking the cue ball, attempting to pocket all of their assigned balls before sinking the 8-ball. 

🎮 How to Play:
When the application launches, players are presented with a simple menu where they can view the rules or begin a match. Starting the game loads a rendered pool table containing a cue ball and a full set of red and blue balls. Player 1 is assigned the red group; Player 2 takes blue.

Aiming is performed using the left and right arrow keys, which rotate the cue direction. Pressing spacebar strikes the cue ball with a fixed shooting force. A new shot cannot be taken until all balls on the table come to a complete stop, ensuring proper turn-taking and predictable gameplay. Balls that enter pockets are removed from play, and each player’s remaining ball count is updated automatically.
