This project is a 2D billiards simulation game developed in Java that applies object-oriented programming and physics concepts to create realistic gameplay. The game models ball motion with velocity, friction, and collision detection to capture accurate interactions, while the table, balls, and cue stick are rendered to scale for a clean and polished look. Players can aim and release the ball through arrow keys and the space bar, and the overall structure is organized into modular classes (Main, GamePanel, GameMenu, Ball) that separate game logic, physics, and graphics.
